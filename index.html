    <p class="me">Hey, My name is Sharon Cohen, I am 24 years old, living in Shlomi, Israel.<br />
     I have always been a curious person, Almost every question I had Started at  <span><b>why?</b></span>,<br /> I always tried to think outside the box and see how the other side thinks, That's why I started learning QA and automation.<br />
     The theme I chose for the site is the guitar, Whether it's rock or blues or metal, there is no end to the sounds that can come out of it.
    <br />
	I will end with a quote from one of the greatest guitarists who has influenced me:<br /><br />
	<span><b>“The only thing that's holding you back, Is the way you're thinking.”</b></span><br /><br />
	--Steve Vai--</p><br />
    <div class="bord2"><h2>&nbsp;Definision Of Guitar?</h2></div>
	<div class="bold">The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.
	It is typically played with both hands by strumming <br />or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one 
    hand, 
	While simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) <br />with the fingers of the other hand. 
	The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, 
	By means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar),<br />Or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker.</div><br>

	<div class="bord4"><h2>Jimmi Hendrix</h2></div>
	<div class="bold">Though his active career as a featured artist lasted a mere four years, 
	Hendrix altered the course of popular music and became one of the most successful<br /> and influential musicians of his era. 
	An instrumentalist who radically redefined the expressive potential and sonic palette of the electric guitar,<br /> 
	he was the composer of a classic repertoire of songs ranging from ferocious rockers to delicate, Complex ballads.
	Hendrix<br /> had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the musical roots on which the cutting-edge rock of his time was based, 
	Hendrix’s work provides a continuing source of inspiration to successive generations of musicians to whom he remains a touchstone for emotional honesty, 
	technological innovation, and an all-inclusive vision of cultural and social brotherhood.</div><br><br>

	For which he earned a Grammy.
	Vaughan was at the forefront of a blues resurgence in the 1980s, 
	<br />Bringing rock fans into the fold with a powerful, 
	driving style of play that earned him comparisons with some of his heroes such as Jimi Hendrix, Otis Rush and Muddy Waters. 
	<br />His four main studio albums were critical and commercial successes, rising high on the music charts and paving the way to sold-out 
	stadium shows across the country.</div><br><br>

    <div class="bord4"><h2>Eddie Van Halen</h2></div>
	<div class="bold">Van Halen was never taught to read music, instead,he would watch recitals of Bach or Mozart and improvise. 
	From 1964 through 1967, He won first place in the annual piano competition held at Long Beach City College.
	His parents wanted the boys to be classical pianists, But Van Halen gravitated towards rock music.
	Consequently, When Alex began playing the guitar, Eddie bought a drum kit for himself, However,
	After he heard Alex's performance of the Surfaris' drum solo in the song "Wipe Out", 
	He gave Alex the drums and began learning how to play the electric guitar.
	According to him, As a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on 
	or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked.
    Van Halen and his brother Alex formed their first band with three other boys, Calling themselves The Broken Combs, 
    Performing at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, When he was in the fourth grade. 
    He would later cite this performance as key to his desire to become a professional musician.</div><br><br>
